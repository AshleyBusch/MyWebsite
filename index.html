        <p style="padding-bottom: 0%;">Hello everyone! If you're on this website it's probably because you like
          music. Well, that makes two of us. On this website, I'll be talking all
          about music. The aspects will range from talking about what kind of music
          you like, to how it can benefit your mental health. So sit back, and enjoy
          the ride!</p>

    <h2>Why I Made This Website</h2>
      <article>
        <p>The main reason I made this website is because I love music.
          It's always been a huge part of my life, and I wouldn't give it up
          for anything. I wanted to make a website where I could talk about
          a topic that I knew a lot about. For me, that's obviously music.
          I want to show people how they can enjoy music, or use it as a
          tool to help them through their everyday lives. People can learn a lot more
          from music than they think.</p>

        <p>My goal with this website is to give people information that they wouldn't
          normally find anywhere else. I want them to gain some sort of helpful knowledge
          from the content on here. Music is a somewhat difficult concept for some people
          to grasp, especially if they aren't good with emotions. That's what I want to
          help people understand: that music conveys emotions that we don't always
          understand by themselves. That's what I'm trying to accomplish with this website.</p>

        <p>Everything that I write on this website will be based on my experience and experiences
          of tother people. I feel like hearing about a shared experience can sometimes
          be more effective than stating plain facts. After all, facts can't explain emotions.
          People get a feeling of liberation when they understand something, and emotions are a
          very difficult thing to try to understand (I don't even understand my own most of the time).
          That won't stop from finding ways to try to understand them. Music is one of the best
          ways to understand yourself, and that's why I love it so much. I hope I can help other people
          understand and discover themselves as well.</p>
