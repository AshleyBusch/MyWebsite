        <p>Hello everyone! If you're on this website it's probably because you like
          music. Well, that makes two of us. On this website, I'll be talking all<br>
          about music. The aspects will range from talking about what kind of music
          you like, to how it can benefit your mental health. So sit back, and enjoy<br>
          the ride!</p>

    <h2>Why I Made This Website</h2>
      <article>
        <p>The main reason I made this website is because I love music.
          It's always been a huge part of my life, and I wouldn't give it up<br>
          for anything. I wanted to make a website where I could talk about
          a topic that I knew a lot about. For me, that's obviously music.<br>
          I want to show people how they can enjoy music, or use it as a
          tool to help them through their everyday lives. People can learn a lot more<br>
          from music than they think.</p>

        <p>My goal with this website is to give people information that they wouldn't
          normally find anywhere else. I want them to gain some sort of helpful knowledge<br>
          from the content on here. Music is a somewhat difficult concept for some people
          to grasp, especially if they aren't good with emotions. That's what I want to<br>
          help people understand: that music conveys emotions that we don't always
          understand by themselves. That's what I'm trying to accomplish with this website.</p>
