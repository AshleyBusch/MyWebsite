      <p>To say that there are specific ways that music can affect everyone is like saying
        that people all act the same in any scenario. There's no one, or two, or even ten
        set ways that music can benenfit people, and that's what's so great about it! Having
        said that, I will list a few common ways that music affects people:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Serves as a source of entertainment</li>
            <li>Changes people's moods</li>
            <li>Calms people down/relaxes them</li>
            <li>Gets people excited/makes them feel alive (especially at a concert)</li>
            <li>Makes them aware that it's possible to explain how you feel/gives them something to connect to</li>
            <li>Puts things into perspective</li>
            <li>Helps people focus</li>
          </ul>
      <p>There's plenty of other ways that music can affect people, but like I said, it's
        impossible to list them all. I could try to explain how music makes people feel,
        but it's very difficult to do without speaking metaphorically. Music does something
        different for everyone, and no matter what that is, it usually benefits them in one
        way or another.</p>

<h2>The Feeling of Liberation</h2>
  <section>
    <article>
      <p>Music, in itself, is a weird and complex subject, but there's one thing it does
        regardless of how it makes you feel: it liberates you. Not literally, but spiritually,
        and it does that better than anything else. Whether you're looking to have a good time,
        trying to relax, trying to better understand yourself, or just trying to find the right
        beat, music always gives you that feeling of liberation. Like when you finally find
        the right song, and something inside you just knows it, you immediately feel more free than
        you did five seconds before you found that song. Something about it just felt right, and
        you can't really comprehend why. It's like being stuck somewhere, and
        finally being able to break free. Like I said, it's hard to explain, but you get the
        point.</p>
