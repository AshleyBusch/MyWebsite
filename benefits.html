      <article>
        <p>To say that there are specific ways that music can affect everyone is like saying
          that people all act the same in any scenario. There's no one, or two, or even ten
          set ways that music can benenfit people, and that's what's so great about it! Having
          said that, I will list a few common ways that music affects people:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Serves as a source of entertainment</li>
              <li>Changes people's moods</li>
              <li>Calms people down/relaxes them</li>
              <li>Gets people excited/makes them feel alive (especially at a concert)</li>
              <li>Makes them aware that it's possible to explain how you feel/gives them something to connect to</li>
              <li>Puts things into perspective</li>
              <li>Helps people focus</li>
            </ul>
        <p>There's plenty of other ways that music can affect people, but like I said, it's
          impossible to list them all. I could try to explain how music makes people feel,
          but it's very difficult to do without speaking metaphorically. Music does something
          different for everyone, and no matter what that is, it usually benefits them in one
          way or another.</p>

      <h2>The Feeling of Liberation</h2>
      <section id="section3-2">
        <article>
          <p id="paragraph3-1">Music, in itself, is a weird and complex subject, but there's one thing it does
            regardless of how it makes you feel: it liberates you. Not literally, but spiritually,
            and it does that better than anything else. Whether you're looking to have a good time,
            trying to relax, trying to better understand yourself, or just trying to find the right
            beat, music always gives you that feeling of liberation. Like when you finally find
            the right song, and something inside you just knows it, you immediately feel more free than
            you did five seconds before you found that song. Something about it just felt right, and
            you can't really comprehend why. It's like being stuck somewhere, and
            finally being able to break free. Like I said, it's hard to explain, but you get the
            point.</p>

          <p>For me, anytime I'm having an off day or I need something to cheer me up, I just get
            my phone out and start listening to music. No matter how good or bad my day has been,
            music has a way of making it better. I've noticed something about people's music choices
            (my own and others'): the music that someone is listening to usually depends on their
            mood/what's happening in their life. Whenever someone is feeling lost or confused, they
            usually tune out the rest of the world by listening to music. It's the best way to clear
            your head or take a minute to think. People can just let go, and let their mind be free.
            (I actually end up doing this a lot, and I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing,
            but oh well.) Others use it in the same way, but for the opposite reason: they tune out
            the world and get in touch with their emotions, and they don't think at all. I wouldn't
            suggest this last thing, but there are some people who like to constantly connect the
            song their listening to to whatever they're thinking about. I end up doing this every
            once in a while, but it gets too confusing when your try to fit someone else's life
            story to fit your own. It usually doesn't work too well, but it is fun to consider all
            of the possibilities of what COULD happen. Sometimes our curiosity can carry us away
            though....</p>

    <h2>It's the BEST Source of Entertainment</h2>
      <article id="article3-1">
        <p>Using music for entertainment is one of it's most common uses. Most people know what it's
          like when you have to do chores of some kind. Pretty boring right? But when you turn on
          some music...well, let's just say that eventually you end up pretending that a broom is
          a microphone stand. When you have people over to eat dinner or play games, or even just
          hang out, usually there's some background music playing. Even if you're just home alone and
          bored, some people like to turn on some music and dance around the house. Or maybe that's
          just me...</p>

        <p>I mean, if we're being real, the entire purpose of a concert is to entertain other people
          with music. Whether you're a concert-goer, or the artist playing the concert, you usually
          end up having fun somehow. --Before I go any further with this, I should probably point out
          that I'm talking about a rock concert, not a band/orchestra/symphony concert (although they'd
          both be fun to me).-- There's something about going to a rock show that just gets people
          pumped up and excited. Going to dinner before the show, meeting up with friends to listen
          to the music that you all love, getting to see your icons perform right in front of you, I
          can't imagine any better feeling than that. The whole experience is a fun way for artists
          to entertain fans in the most excting and fun way there is.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Of course, not everyone is a rocker. There are plenty of alternatives to rock concerts. In
          fact, a common one among my friends is musicals/musical movies. A lot of them actual like
          the broadway musical <i>Hamilton</i>, which I personally don't like, but it's very popular.
          I haven't had the privilege of going to a real broadway musical, but I'd like to some day.
          High school musicals are not always a bad alternative though. In fact there have been several
          good musical productions at my school. Last year, they did <i>The Sound of Music</i>, and they
          did a pretty good job with it. Sadly, not every school has the advantage of having such a
          musically talented group of students. Again, I'm not exactly an expert on musicals, but I do
          like some musical movies. Disney would be the prime example of musical movie making. And hey,
          who doesn't like a good Disney movie every now and then? There are plenty of musical movies
          outside of Disney though. For example, I'm sure most people have heard of <i>The Greatest
          Showman</i> by now. It was released almost a year ago now, and I don't know about anyone else,
          but I still listen to the soundtrack for it when I feel like it.</p>

    <h2>Explains Emotions</h2>
      <article id="article3-2">
        <p>**I'd like to point out that this section is going to be very contradictory, but I'll try my best**</p>

        <p>I'm not entirely sure what the best way for me to explain this would be, but this is as
          simply as I can put it: Music explains/conveys people's emotions better than anything. As people,
          we know that sometimes we can't always find the right thing to say, or we don't know how to
          explain something, and others can end up getting very confused. Music, whether it has lyrics or
          not, makes more sense to us than just trying to explain something to someone. That doesn't make any
          sense if you think about it. Writing the lyrics to song ALONE takes so much more time to do, and
          understand, than simply stating how you feel. Yet, it somehow makes more sense to us to hear someone
          speak metaphorically than literally. I don't know anything about psychology, so I couldn't tell you
          why we think that way, but we do. Emotions make more sense the less we try to explain them and the
          more we convey them through a form of art.</p>

        <p id="paragraph3-3">(This may not seem like I actually have a point, but I do I promise.) Being able to describe and
          understand yours and others' emotions is very important. When you hear an artist's song, it's most
          likely describing an event in their life that had a strong emotion tethered to it. (Hint: that's
          why there's so many love songs in this world; because love is a strong feeling.) People have learned
          how to connect other artists' songs to their own lives. That feeling that something can match
          your life like a song does, it lets people know that they're not alone. Other people have gone through
          similar circumstances that the listener can connect to, and depending on the context of the song,
          it can really put things into perspective for them. It can give them hope, and that's one of the
          most important things any artist can give.</p>

    <h2>Helps You Focus</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Sometimes, people can get caught up with what's going on around them and they lose focus. Music is
          a great tool to use to regain focus in several scenarios. When you're doing homework/work, you're deep
          in thought, or you just zone out, music can help you regain your focus. I know that for me, music can
          make things seem like they take less time as well. If you have homework, work, a project, a chore, a
          dinner to make, or anything else, music can make the time fly by. We live in a world with many
          distractions, and music can help tune those distractions out so we can focus on what's important.
          It may not seem likely, but you can turn lots of long days into fun days just by adding in some music.
          That's what I did, and truthfully, it is what gets me through most days. I always listen to music while
          I do homework, while I'm doing chores, or while I'm preparing a meal/dessert. It seriously does make
          everything a lot more fun (and tolerable). So, take my word for it, and listen to music while you're
          doing busy work. You won't regret it!</p>
