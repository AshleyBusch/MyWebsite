      <p>To say that there are specific ways that music can affect everyone is like saying
        that people all act the same in any scenario. There's no one, or two, or even ten
        set ways that music can benenfit people, and that's what's so great about it! Having
        said that, I will list a few common ways that music affects people:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Serves as a source of entertainment</li>
            <li>Changes people's moods</li>
            <li>Calms people down/relaxes them</li>
            <li>Gets people excited/makes them feel alive (especially at a concert)</li>
            <li>Makes them aware that it's possible to explain how you feel/gives them something to connect to</li>
            <li>Puts things into perspective</li>
            <li>Helps people focus</li>
          </ul>
      <p>There's plenty of other ways that music can affect people, but like I said, it's
        impossible to list them all. I could try to explain how music makes people feel,
        but it's very difficult to do without speaking metaphorically. Music does something
        different for everyone, and no matter what that is, it usually benefits them in one
        way or another.</p>

<h2>The Feeling of Liberation</h2>
  <section>
    <article>
      <p>Music, in itself, is a weird and complex subject, but there's one thing it does
        regardless of how it makes you feel: it liberates you. Not literally, but spiritually,
        and it does that better than anything else. Whether you're looking to have a good time,
        trying to relax, trying to better understand yourself, or just trying to find the right
        beat, music always gives you that feeling of liberation. Like when you finally find
        the right song, and something inside you just knows it, you immediately feel more free than
        you did five seconds before you found that song. Something about it just felt right, and
        you can't really comprehend why. It's like being stuck somewhere, and
        finally being able to break free. Like I said, it's hard to explain, but you get the
        point.</p>

        <p>For me, anytime I'm having an off day or I need something to cheer me up, I just get
          my phone out and start listening to music. No matter how good or bad my day has been,
          music has a way of making it better. I've noticed something about people's music choices
          (my own and others'): the music that someone is listening to usually depends on their
          mood/what's happening in their life. Whenever someone is feeling lost or confused, they
          usually tune out the rest of the world by listening to music. It's the best way to clear
          your head or take a minute to think. People can just let go, and let their mind be free.
          (I actually end up doing this a lot, and I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing,
          but oh well.) Others use it in the same way, but for the opposite reason: they tune out
          the world and get in touch with their emotions, and they don't think at all. I wouldn't
          suggest this last thing, but there are some people who like to constantly connect the
          song their listening to to whatever they're thinking about. I end up doing this every
          once in a while, but it gets too confusing when your try to fit someone else's life
          story to fit your own. It usually doesn't work too well, but it is fun to consider all
          of the possibilities of what COULD happen. Sometimes our curiosity can carry us away
          though....</p>

          <p>Music is great, but it can lead to a whole lot of over-thinking and over-feeling.
            Don't worry, I'll move on to the more fun aspects of music's benefits shortly!</p>
