      <aside>Oh, the joy of music...</aside>
      <article>
        <p>To say that there are specific ways that music can affect everyone is like saying
          that people all act the same in any scenario. There's no one, or two, or even ten
          set ways that music can benenfit people, and that's what's so great about it! Having
          said that, I will list a few common ways that music affects people:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Serves as a source of entertainment</li>
              <li>Changes people's moods</li>
              <li>Calms people down/relaxes them</li>
              <li>Gets people excited/makes them feel alive (especially at a concert)</li>
              <li>Makes them aware that it's possible to explain how you feel/gives them something to connect to</li>
              <li>Puts things into perspective</li>
              <li>Helps people focus</li>
            </ul>
        <p>There's plenty of other ways that music can affect people, but like I said, it's
          impossible to list them all. I could try to explain how music makes people feel,
          but it's very difficult to do without speaking metaphorically. Music does something
          different for everyone, and no matter what that is, it usually benefits them in one
          way or another.</p>

      <h2>The Feeling of Liberation</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Music, in itself, is a weird and complex subject, but there's one thing it does
            regardless of how it makes you feel: it liberates you. Not literally, but spiritually,
            and it does that better than anything else. Whether you're looking to have a good time,
            trying to relax, trying to better understand yourself, or just trying to find the right
            beat, music always gives you that feeling of liberation. Like when you finally find
            the right song, and something inside you just knows it, you immediately feel more free than
            you did five seconds before you found that song. Something about it just felt right, and
            you can't really comprehend why. It's like being stuck somewhere, and
            finally being able to break free. Like I said, it's hard to explain, but you get the
            point.</p>

          <p>For me, anytime I'm having an off day or I need something to cheer me up, I just get
            my phone out and start listening to music. No matter how good or bad my day has been,
            music has a way of making it better. I've noticed something about people's music choices
            (my own and others'): the music that someone is listening to usually depends on their
            mood/what's happening in their life. Whenever someone is feeling lost or confused, they
            usually tune out the rest of the world by listening to music. It's the best way to clear
            your head or take a minute to think. People can just let go, and let their mind be free.
            (I actually end up doing this a lot, and I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing,
            but oh well.) Others use it in the same way, but for the opposite reason: they tune out
            the world and get in touch with their emotions, and they don't think at all. I wouldn't
            suggest this last thing, but there are some people who like to constantly connect the
            song their listening to to whatever they're thinking about. I end up doing this every
            once in a while, but it gets too confusing when your try to fit someone else's life
            story to fit your own. It usually doesn't work too well, but it is fun to consider all
            of the possibilities of what COULD happen. Sometimes our curiosity can carry us away
            though....</p>

          <p>Music is great, but it can lead to a whole lot of over-thinking and over-feeling.
            Don't worry, I'll move on to the more fun aspects of music's benefits shortly!</p>

    <h2>It's the BEST Source of Entertainment</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Using music for entertainment is one of it's most common uses. Most people know what it's
          like when you have to do chores of some kind. Pretty boring right? But when you turn on
          some music...well, let's just say that eventually you end up pretending that a broom is
          a microphone stand. When you have people over to eat dinner or play games, or even just
          hang out, usually there's some background music playing. Even if you're just home alone and
          bored, some people like to turn on some music and dance around the house. Or maybe that's
          just me...</p>

        <p>I mean, if we're being real, the entire purpose of a concert is to entertain other people
          with music. Whether you're a concert-goer, or the artist playing the concert, you usually
          end up having fun somehow. --Before I go any further with this, I should probably point out
          that I'm talking about a rock concert, not a band/orchestra/symphony concert (although they'd
          both be fun to me).-- There's something about going to a rock show that just gets people
          pumped up and excited. Going to dinner before the show, meeting up with friends to listen
          to the music that you all love, getting to see your icons perform right in front of you, I
          can't imagine any better feeling than that. The whole experience is a fun way for artists
          to entertain fans in the most excting and fun way there is.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <p>Of course, not everyone is a rocker. There are plenty of alternatives to rock concerts. In
          fact, a common one among my friends is musicals/musical movies. A lot of them actual like
          the broadway musical <i>Hamilton</i>, which I personally don't like, but it's very popular.
          I haven't had the privilege of going to a real broadway musical, but I'd like to some day.
          High school musicals are not always a bad alternative though. In fact there have been several
          good musical productions at my school. Again, I'm not exactly an expert on musicals, but I do
          like some musical movies. Disney would be the prime example of musical movie making. There are
          other ones as well. For example, I'm sure most people have heard of <i>The Greatest Showman</i>
          by now.</p>
