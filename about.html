    <h1>Music Has Completely <i>Changed</i> My Life</h1>
      <h2>Types of Music I Like</h2>
      <section id="section 1">
        <article>
          <p>As you can tell, I'm a total music geek. I love everything about it. Music has
        always been a universal language. In my opinion, it conveys emotions/feelings<br>
        better than anything else. There are so many different kinds of music too, from
        hip-hop to classical to heavy metal. There's a type of music for everyone!</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <p>Now, for me, I only like certain types of music. As far as listening to/singing
            songs goes, I like a LOT of current pop and some classic rock. I also have a<br>
            soft spot for emotional ballads (songs with really powerful messages). However, I
            do NOT like country or rap at all, or at least any current music in those genres.<br>
            There's one category that could go either way for me: musicals. For example, I
            absolutely LOVE <i>The Greatest Showman</i>, but I can't stand <i>Hamilton</i>.<br>
            (Don't get me started on Disney movies because I can tell you right now that you will
            hear WAY more than you want to know about how much I love them.) Anyways, those are<br>
            the types of music that I personally enjoy listening to.</p>

    <h2>The Life of a Band Kid</h2>
      <section id="section 2">
        <article>
          <p>Now let's talk about my other music obession: band. I've been in band for a few
            years now, which doesn't seem like a long time, but it's been the best few years of<br>
            my life. I'm currently in my high school's(Licking Heights) wind ensemble, which is
            our top band. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you what I play! I play flute and piccolo,<br>
            and it's so much fun. I decided to play piccolo in marching band as well....which
            has been the best and worst decision I've ever made, for multiple reasons. Don't get<br>
            me wrong, I love playing the piccolo and all, but sometimes it's just really annoying.
            I think I've caused myself a little bit of permanent ear damage because of it(use earplugs<br>
            kids). Also, don't believe that rumor about piccolos never being in tune, because it's
            not true. They aren't very hard to tune at all. One good thing about it is that it's<br>
            travel-sized, and very lightweight. Don't let it's cute look fool you...it's not what it
            seems. Did you know that a flute takes more air to play than a tuba? And a piccolo takes<br>
            more air to play than a flute? Well, now you know.<p>

          <p>Sorry, I got a little bit off topic up there. Anyways, playing piccolo in marching band
            has it's pros and cons, but we can talk about those later. Marching Band in general is<br>
            literally my favorite thing ever. I've made so many memories, good and bad, in the time
            that I've been in it, but what I'll never forget is all of the friends I've made. My squad<br>
            (the flute squad) is the best, and I love each and every person in it to death. My friends
            who are upperclassmen (mostly the seniors) have definitely given me some good advice and<br>
            helped me navigate my way through the beginnning of high school. I can't thank them enough
            for that. And to think that all of this happened because I love music...now that's pretty crazy.</p>

    <h2>Outside of Heights Band</h2>
  </section>
  <section id="section 4">
      <article>
        <p>I don't do whole lot outside of wind ensemble and marching band, and that's probably a good
          thing schedule-wise. However, I do take private lessons for flute and piccolo as<br>
          well. My lesson teacher is <a href="http://www.angelaheckmueller.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Angela Heck Mueller</a>
          and she is hands down the best flute player I've ever met (which makes sense, since that's
          what she teaches).<br>
          I love her to death and I could not ask for a better or more understanding teacher. I totally
          recommend her to anyone that's thinking about taking flute/piccolo lessons, it really<br>
          helps a lot. I have lessons once a week for half an hour each, and I have assigned music that
          I have learn and perfect over the course of that week. It really is so much fun, and you<br>
          get a lot out of it. I've found that it makes wind ensemble and marching band much easier.</p>
