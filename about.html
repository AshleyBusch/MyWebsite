    <h1>Music Has Completely <b>Changed</b> My Life</h1>

          <p>As you can tell, I'm a total music geek. I love everything about it. Music has<br>
        always been a universal language. In my opinion, it conveys emotions/feelings<br>
        better than anything else. There are so many different kinds of music too, from<br>
        hip-hop to classical to heavy metal. There's a type of music for everyone!</p>

          <p>Now, for me, I only like certain types of music. As far as listening to/singing<br>
            songs goes, I like a LOT of current pop and some classic rock. I also have a<br>
            soft spot for emotional ballads (songs with really powerful messages). However, I<br>
            do NOT like country or rap at all, or at least any current music in those genres.<br>
            There's one category that could go either way for me: musicals. For example, I<br>
            absolutely LOVE <i>The Greatest Showman</i>, but I can't stand <i>Hamilton</i>.<br>
            (Don't get me started on Disney movies because I can tell you right now that you will<br>
            hear WAY more than you want to know about how much I love them.) Anyways, those are<br>
            the types of music that I personally enjoy listening to.</p>

          <p>Now let's talk about my other music obession: band. I've been in band for a few<br>
            years now, which doesn't seem like a long time, but it's been the best few years of<br>
            my life. I'm currently in my high school's(Licking Heights) wind ensemble, which is<br>
            our top band. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you what I play! I play flute and piccolo,<br>
            which has been the best and worst decision I've ever made.
