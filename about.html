    <h1>Music Has Completely <i>Changed</i> My Life</h1>
      <h2>Types of Music I Like</h2>
      <section id="section1">
        <article>
          <p>As you can tell, I'm a total music geek. I love everything about it. Music has
        always been a universal language. In my opinion, it conveys emotions/feelings<br>
        better than anything else. There are so many different kinds of music too, from
        hip-hop to classical to heavy metal. There's a type of music for everyone!</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <p>Now, for me, I only like certain types of music. As far as listening to/singing
            songs goes, I like a LOT of current pop and some classic rock. I also have a<br>
            soft spot for emotional ballads (songs with really powerful messages). However, I
            do NOT like country or rap at all, or at least any current music in those genres.<br>
            There's one category that could go either way for me: musicals. For example, I
            absolutely LOVE <i>The Greatest Showman</i>, but I can't stand <i>Hamilton</i>.<br>
            (Don't get me started on Disney movies because I can tell you right now that you will
            hear WAY more than you want to know about how much I love them.) Anyways, those are<br>
            the types of music that I personally enjoy listening to.</p>

    <h2>The Life of a Band Kid</h2>
      <section id="section2">
        <article>
          <p>Now let's talk about my other music obession: band. I've been in band for a few
            years now, which doesn't seem like a long time, but it's been the best few years of<br>
            my life. I'm currently in my high school's(Licking Heights) wind ensemble, which is
            our top band. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you what I play! I play flute and piccolo,<br>
            and it's so much fun. I decided to play piccolo in marching band as well....which
            has been the best and worst decision I've ever made, for multiple reasons. Don't get<br>
            me wrong, I love playing the piccolo and all, but sometimes it's just really annoying.
            I think I've caused myself a little bit of permanent ear damage because of it(use earplugs<br>
            kids). Also, don't believe that rumor about piccolos never being in tune, because it's
            not true. They aren't very hard to tune at all. One good thing about it is that it's<br>
            travel-sized, and very lightweight. Don't let it's cute look fool you...it's not what it
            seems. Did you know that a flute takes more air to play than a tuba? And a piccolo takes<br>
            more air to play than a flute? Well, now you know.<p>

          <p>Sorry, I got a little bit off topic up there. Anyways, playing piccolo in marching band
            has it's pros and cons, but we can talk about those later. Marching Band in general is<br>
            literally my favorite thing ever. I've made so many memories, good and bad, in the time
            that I've been in it, but what I'll never forget is all of the friends I've made. My squad<br>
            (the flute squad) is the best, and I love each and every person in it to death. My friends
            who are upperclassmen (mostly the seniors) have definitely given me some good advice and<br>
            helped me navigate my way through the beginnning of high school. I can't thank them enough
            for that. </p>

    <h2>Outside of Heights Band</h2>
  <section id="section5">
      <article>
        <p>I don't do whole lot outside of wind ensemble and marching band, and that's probably a good
          thing schedule-wise. However, I do take private lessons for flute and piccolo as<br>
          well. My lesson teacher is <a href="http://www.angelaheckmueller.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Angela Heck Mueller</a>,
          and she is hands down the best flute player I've ever met (which makes sense, since that's
          what she teaches).<br>
          I love her to death and I could not ask for a better or more understanding teacher. I totally
          recommend her to anyone that's thinking about taking flute/piccolo lessons, it really<br>
          helps a lot. I have lessons once a week for half an hour each, and I have assigned music that
          I have learn and perfect over the course of that week. It really is so much fun, and you<br>
          get a lot out of it. I've found that it makes wind ensemble and marching band much easier.</p>

          <p>On top of band and private lessons, I do plan on joining a flute choir eventually. My
            teacher actually directs 3 different flute choirs (middle school, high school, and adult)<br>
            Once my schedule allows more time, maybe I'll be able to be in one of them, but for now,
            marching band is still my main focus. Here's the thing about marching band: it consumes<br>
            your life for the first few months of school (and a little bit of your summer break). If
            you're in percussion or color guard, it does even more so. That's the only reason I decided <br>
            not to join a flute choir at the beginning of this school year. Well, that and the fact that I'm
            taking 3 honors classes and I didn't know what to expect with those. I just didn't want to do<br>
            more than I knew I could handle. Maybe next year though...</p>

<h2>Music in my Everyday Life</h2>
  <section id="section6">
    <article>
      <p>As far as my non-band music life goes, I don't do more than the average person does while
        enjoying music. I don't dance, I'm not in choir, I'm not part of a garage band or<br>
        anything like that. Really all I do is listen to music (and sometimes sing along). Although I'm
        not in choir, I have been told my several of my friends that I should be. I told them no.<br>
        It's not because I don't like to sing, I just don't want to be told what to sing or when to do
        it. I do it out of my own free will. Plus, it would SUCK to have a sore throat or a cold, or<br>
        any other sickness and have to sing every day.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <p>Like I said earlier, I mainly listen to pop--and sometimes rock--music. I don't just listen
        to the most popular songs on the radio, I like specific artists. As a kid, I was mostly<br>
        exposed to one of two types of music: my parents music or kiddy TV show songs. I didn't really
        discover my style and taste in music until later on. The first real artist I started<br>
        listening to was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Carpenter" target="_blank">Sabrina Carpenter</a>. However, I did discover her through Disney Channel. We
        all have that artist thought, right? I also like other pop artists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Mendes" target="blank">Shawn Mendes</a>,<br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Puth" target="_blank">Charlie Puth</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroon_5" target="_blank">Maroon 5</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Lovato" target="_blank">Demi Lovato</a>, and several others.
        I will say, I have been listening to a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic!_at_the_Disco" target="_blank">Panic! At The Disco</a> lately...<br></p>

        <p>The rock music that I listen to is mostly classic rock. I would name off all of those artists
        that I like, but there are just too many. One of my favorite classic rock artists is<br>
        definitely the band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)" target="_blank">Queen</a>. I will admit that's mostly because of "Bohemian Rhapsody", but
        who doesn't like that song? I also like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(band)" target="_blank">Journey</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosmith" target="_blank">Aerosmith</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns_N%27_Roses" target="_blank">Guns 'N Roses</a>, and several<br>
        others. Rock music is the best type of music to, well, rock out to. Whether you're having a party with
        friends, or you a date with music, rock is the best type of music to get people <br>
        pumped up about something.</p>

        <p>Every once in a while, I'll sit down and think to myself: <i>Man, I miss that one disney
          movie.</i> Between the classic Disney movies and Disney Channel original movies,<br>
          I always seem to find one that I just miss hearing the music from. For me, those movies
          are usually <i>High School Musical</i> (1, 2, or 3) or <i>Tangled</i>. Sometimes I'll get<br>
          bored with all of the modern pop I listen to and I'll just pull up a soundtrack for one of
          those movies and just reminisce in my childhood memories. I always go all out when I sing<br>
          to those songs, even though I kind of feel like an idiot when I do. Oh well. It's a lot of
          fun though, trust me. Besides, what's the harm in reliving your childhood?</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <p>You're probably sitting there thinking "Man, can she ever get enough music?". Haha, that's
        funny...the answer is no. I don't remember the last time I've gone a day wihtout<br>
        listening to, singing, humming, playing, or memorizing some sort of music. Now it probably sounds like
        I'm a music addict, oops. It's not that I physically can't go without msuic, it<br>
        just hasn't happened. It definitely helps me get through the day (whether that's a good thing or a bad
        thing I'm not really sure). Whether I just have minute to rock out, or I'm trying to<br>
        make myself feel better, it always puts me in a better mood.</p>

      <p>Music is said to be a universal language, and quite honestly, that's one of the best ways to
        describe it. No matter where you're from, there's a type of music for you. Anyone<br>
        can understand the message of a song, no matter who it's written by. Music just has a way of speaking
        to everyone, which is probably why I like it so much, because if people<br>
        tried hard enough they could understand it. Every song I listen to has a way of relating to some aspect
        of my life. They all have a good way of explaining a person's feelings, and<br>
        a lot of times it helps put things into perspective for me. There's definitely a lot more you can learn from
        music than meets the eye. It's the best way for me to pick myself back up<br>
        when I'm struggling. Another thing music does for me is it gives me a way to relate to other people,
        whether that's a friend, family member, or even a fictional character. Depending<br>
        on what the song is about, it can give us a lot to talk about, as both musicians and people.
        Music brings people together.</p>
