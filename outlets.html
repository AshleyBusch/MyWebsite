  <aside>So much music!</aside>
   <article>
    <p>There's so many different options for people who want to get into music. From becoming a total band nerd to starting
      a garage band, I believe there's something for everyone. Now I don't know everything, but I do love music, and
      I can list a handful of ways for people to incorporate music into their lives:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Join your school's concert band</li>
        <li>Join your school's marching band</li>
        <li>Join your school's choir</li>
        <li>Join a church choir</li>
        <li>Join an acapella group</li>
        <li>Audition for a musical</li>
        <li>Start a band with your friends</li>
        <li>Take private lessons(for singing or an instrument you play)</li>
        <li>Watch online tutorials on how to play an instrument you're interested in</li>
        <li>Take a songwriting/composing class</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Of course there are ENDLESS options, but these (in my opinion) are the main ones. So, let's jump right in and
      talk about them!</p>

  <h2>Band</h2>
    <article>
      <p id="paragraph4-1">(I know I've already talked about band a lot, so we're gonna get that out of the way first). There are a
        lot of great things that band can offer, like the opportunity to make 50+ new friends that you will play with
        for the next several years. Band is one of the best ways (in my opinion) to dive into the technicalities
        of music. From day one, students are taught how to read sheet music, how to play their instrument, and how
        to connect the two. It allows you to connect to music through style and interpretation. It is a lot of hard
        work and practice, and everyone has to do their part for the band to sound great. Joining band opens up so
        many new opportunities for aspiring musicians, like playing at special events(openings of new buildings,
        weddings, other ceremonious events), ajudicated performances, or specific honor bands. There's just so many
        great things about it.</p>

      <div id="reset" style="background-color: lightgray; border: none;"></div>

      <p>Marching band is similar to regular band in some aspects: you get music, practice, and perform; but it's
        also much more than that. The main difference in that it involves physical activity, or at least a lot more
        of it than regular band. Everyone still has to do their part in order for the band to function properly,
        even more so in this case because there's a visual aspect to it. Marching band is essentially concert band
        (aka regular band) on steroids. Every year, a typical marching band performs a new show. Everyone in the
        band gets a really long piece of music, a number, and a set of spots on the field (drill cards). Once everyone
        learns their music, they have to put the music together with their drill spots and move from one to the
        other using the music as a guide. Usually a band would start learning it's show during band camp over the
        summer, and they have about 4 months to learn and perfect it for their state contests. Marching band will
        take over those 4 months out of the year as long as you do it, but it is 100% worth it. Joining marching
        band is hands down the best decision I've ever made. Joining either concert or marching band (or both), is
        something that I would definitely recommemd to everyone. Everyone goes through their ups and downs together
        in band, and they become a family. What more could you want than a big family of band nerds?</p>

  <h2>Singing</h2>
   <article>
     <p id="paragraph4-2">Now, I'm not an expert on choir, and I can't speak from experience, but I have many friends that are in
       choir. Choir is definitely a good outlet for people who don't want to play an instrument but still want to
       be involved in music. Just like band, everyone is expected to do their part in order for the ensemble to
       sound great. Singing is quite possibly the best way to interpret music, because it uses style, but it also
       has lyrics, whereas band doesn't. It requires a similar work ethic to concert band, and in some ways it can
       be much harder. The voice is an ever changing instrument, and can be unpredictable at times, and while
       that makes it hard to control, it also makes it one of the most interesting to develop. There are many
       different types of choirs that people can join, between school choirs and church choirs, there's a good
       range of them that people could consider. In other words, if you love singing, join choir.</p>

      <figure id="figure4-2">
        <img src="my website images/choirimage.jpg" width="100%" alt="Choir">
      </figure>
      <div id="reset" style="background-color: white; border: none;"></div>

     <p>There are other singing related things besides choir that people could consider, such as acapella groups
       or musicals. On top of having multiple choirs, my school also has an acapella group and a spring musical
       every year. I would basically describe an acapella group as a self-run, more free flowing mini choir (if
       that makes any sense). And in an acapella group, everyone has a conpletely different role to fill. Which leads
       me to my next topic: musicals. Auditioning for a musical is probably the most outgoing way to get into music.
       It requires a lot of confidence and maturity, and a musical can either turn out really good or really bad
       depending on those qualities. Again, I can't speak from experience on these topics, but that's my
       interpretation of them. I would highly encourage the bolder vocalists out there to consider these options
       as well. It would be really fun!</p>

   <h2>Taking Lessons</h2>
    <article>
     <p>This subject is one that I can speak about from experience. Whether you're taking private lessons for
       singing or playing an instrumemt, I cam tell you right now that it will help you much more than you
       think it will. Some people think of taking private lessons as extra help for people who are struggling,
       but most of the time it's people who are already really good doing something extra to get better. Taking
       private lessons is a great way for students to focus on their individual skills amd make them better
       than they already are. Having someone who specializes in your instrument and getting some one on one
       time to talk to them and learn from them is so helpful for students who are finding their way through
       the wide world of music. You can get the same thing from watching online tutorials and following along,
       and it'll cost you a lot less most likely, but it won't quite have the same effect. Regardless, both of
       these methods can be helpful to people who are starting a new instrument or want to get even better at
       what they already play.</p>

   <h2>Creating Your Own Sound</h2>
    <article id="article4-1">
     <p>This particular outlet is a little more difficult to describe than the previous ones. There are many
       ways to simply get involved in music, but what about creating your own? This is the most difficult
       part about making music. Althought it's not as common as it was 20 hears ago, starting a band is a
       great way to start off a life of music your own unique way. You and the other people in your band
       can find and create your own sound together in a more collaborative way than anything else. You get
       to create your own beats, melodies, harmonies, and lyrics with the people you love working with. How
       much better could music life get?</p>

     <p>Songwriting/composing is just the fancy term for creating your own sound. This is literally the most
       difficult aspect of music. It makes you think about your feelings more than you ever thought you would
       have to, and sometimes it can get confusing. Once you learn how to actually write music, you have to
       be consistent in writing it, or the creative flow might be hard to get back into. Taking a class on how
       to properly write good music that people will actually want to hear isn't a bad idea. There isn't much
       else for me to explain about this topic, it's one of those things you have to know and feel rather than
       have it be explained to you. That's all there is too it!
