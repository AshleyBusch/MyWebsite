  <aside>So much music!</aside>
   <article>
    <p>There's so many different options for people who want to get into music. From becoming a total band to starting
      a garage band, I believe there's something for everyone. Now I don't know everything, but I do love music, and
      I can list a handful of ways for people to incorporate music into their lives:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Join your school's concert band</li>
        <li>Join your school's marching band</li>
        <li>Join your school's choir</li>
        <li>Join a church choir</li>
        <li>Join an acapella group</li>
        <li>Audition for a musical</li>
        <li>Start a band with your friends</li>
        <li>Take private lessons(for singing or an instrument you play)</li>
        <li>Watch online tutorials on how to play an instrument you're interested in</li>
        <li>Take a songwriting/composing class</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Of course there are ENDLESS options, but these (in my opinion) are the main ones. So, let's jump right in and 
      talk about them!</p>
